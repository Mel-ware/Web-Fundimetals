                                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
                                making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
                                at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more 
                                obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and 
                                going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
                                discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 
                                1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes 
                                of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a 
                                treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the 
                                Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit 
                                amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced 
                                below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de 
                                Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their 
                                exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 
                                translation by H. Rackham.
